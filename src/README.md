# React Movies Queue

## Demo

You can see the finished demo here:

## Description

This is a light weight React Project intended to help teach coding, styling and testing React Components.

The application is a movie queue. On page load a list of movie cards will be available. Each card will have an add to queue button, that will add the movie to the back of the queue.

Users will be able to add, remove and clear their queue.

## What to do

For this project using the upper right fork button in codesandbox.

If you prefer you can also fork this project in Github and run it locally.

Since this is an introductory course to React, we will avoid getting into the AJAX call powering our results. Instead we will focus on styling and building out the functionality of each of our components:

- Movie List
- Movie List Item Cards
- Add to queue button
- Movie Queue
- Movie Queue cards
- Remove from queue button
- Clear queue button

## Test Driven Development

For our workshop, we're going to cover React basics, but also teach how to get the most out of your development workflow by practicing test driven development.

Our chosen test runner is Jest. You can find a link to the Jest documents in the resource section of this document.
